2. Links user to bootloader & firmware downloads
3. Github release bundles include Loopj's OpenOCD fork - no extra software needed!
4. Step by step on screen guide
5. Seperate window with logs & console output for debugging and transparency

## Planned Features
1. "Pro" layout - for bulk flashing & time savings
3. Support for macOS and Linux 
4. Robust error handling with troubleshooting steps included
5. Optional Rpi Pico flashing

## Credits
Credit for the WavePhoenix Utility project largely goes to loopj for creating the core WavePhoenix project. Without Loopj's hard work, this tool would have no reason to exist.

Special thanks to members of the GameCube modding community for inspiring me to solve this issue.

Built with Python & Qt6, packaged using PyInstaller.
